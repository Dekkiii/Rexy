            1. The cause of this might be that you're trying a print on a different paper size and to fix this try to check the paper size of your document and make sure that it is on <b>A4</b>.<br>
            2. If you're on Word, click on Layout Tab then Size.<br>
            <img src="img/size1.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%"><br><br>
            <img src="img/size2.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%"><br><br><br>
            3. Be sure to choose the A4 size as shown in the picture.<br>
            <img src="img/size3.png" alt="" width="20%" height="20%"><br><br><br>
            4. Try printing again if this solves the problem. If not, you can also change the paper size on the printer. <br>
            5. The same can be applied as well with other microsoft office applications such as excel, ppt, etc.<br>
