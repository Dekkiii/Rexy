            <p>
                1. Once you notice that your hinge is broken/cracked, try not to fold your laptop too much because it can cause it more harm. <br><br>
                2. Take picture of the damaged part and show it to IT dept asap. <br><br>
                3. As much as possible, try not to get your device wet or being pushed on too hard as it is already extra fragile given that the hinge is already broken.
