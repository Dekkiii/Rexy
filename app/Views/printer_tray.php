            1. This error code is quite a common occurence, this mean that either the paper inside the paper tray is not the correct size or there's no paper at all.<br>
            2. In order to fix this, first is check whether the paper in the tray is the correct one.<br>
            3. If it is correct, then just try to get all the paper and put it back in the tray while keeping them neat and tight.<br>
            4. Try printing again and see if the problem still occur.<br><br><br>
