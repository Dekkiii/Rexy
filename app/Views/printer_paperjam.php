            1. With Paper Jam, it is quite easy to fix since the screen on the printer will display where the paper jam is. Just follow the instructions on the screen which looks something like this: <br>
            <img src="img/jam1.png" alt="" width="60%" height="60%"><br><br><br>
            2. Try printing again and see if the problem has been fixed. <br>
            3. If it's still not fixed yet then just try again, it really is just a matter of trial and error when it comes to paper jam. <br><br><br>
