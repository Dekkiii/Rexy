        <h2>Steps on using the Projector</h2>
        <p>Projector is very important and is being used by everybody whenver there's an event or meetings. <br><br>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
            1. Double-check everything first from wires, the extension and the projector itself. Normally when borrowing the projector from the IT dept they will give you the <b>unit itself, an hdmi cable, remote, power cable, and the extension</b>.<br>
            2. Plug the HDMI cable in your device and also behind the projector, it should look like this: <br>
            <img src="img/hdmi.png" alt="" ><br><br>
            3. Plug the power cable behind the projector and the extension. <br>
            4. Check if its working by now, if not then try checking the <i><b>source</b></i> in the projector if its in HDMI. <br>
            5. If the source is not the problem, press <b>Windows + P key</b> to open the project tab on the right side of your screen and click on <b>duplicate</b> if you want to mirror your screen and extend if you want to use it as second monitor making it independent from your laptop screen.<br>
